# Rstudio-journal
A walkthrough for Rstudio beginners

As an undergraduate in biology at MSU Denver, I encountered Rstudio in environmental statistics and a beginner course in R coding language. I thoroughly enjoyed learning these skills, but without the structure of a formal class setting I haven't been practicing. This Rstudio journal will track my personal progress in coding with Rstudio. I'm going to start with installation and basic concepts, to build up the momentum needed to solve more complicated coding problems. Through markdown files, I want to make the information easily accessable, with myself as the target audience. This same information with also be posted in articles on medium.com, where my profile is @misoconnor.
